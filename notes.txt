Difference between window screen and document in javascript:

Window:
    window is the execution context and global object for that context's JavaScript,
    Each browser tab has its own top-level window object. Each element has its own window object too, nested within a parent window.

Screen:
    Screen describes the physical display's full screen,
    The portion of a screen displaying the rendered document is the viewport in JavaScript, which is potentially confusing because 
    we call an application's portion of the screen a window when talking about interactions with the operating system

Document:
    The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree.
     When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser ,it becomes a document object. It is the root node of the HTML document
